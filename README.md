# CodeSamples
Code samples from my python libraries for personal use

As of 2018-03-12, these were mostly coded in the last 6 months (during which I have been on a steep Python learning curve).

While many of the functions/classes herein could be easily adapted and used by someone else, some of this code may depend on my computer's environment variables, directory structure, or other python libraries that are not included here.  Some of it is also a work in progress, and includes my reminders to come back and finish tasks (like linting, adding doc strings).
